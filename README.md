# Recommendation-System
##  Project Name: Coders of Delhi

This project involved two major parts:

1.] Data Cleaning - I worked with a messy JSON file and cleaned it using only basic Python 
👉 Best part? No libraries - no Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, or even Machine Learning involved!

2.] People You May Know - Built a mini recommendation system that suggests friend connections using mutual friends logic - just like how social media does it behind the scenes 🤝

💡 This project taught me a lot about how raw data is structured, how to clean it, and how simple logic can power smart recommendations.🚀
